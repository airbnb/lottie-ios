/// `AnimationKeypath` is an object that describes a keypath search for nodes in the
/// animation JSON. `AnimationKeypath` matches views and properties inside of `LottieAnimationView`
/// to their backing `LottieAnimation` model by name.
///
/// A keypath can be used to set properties on an existing animation, or can be validated
/// with an existing `LottieAnimation`.
///
/// `AnimationKeypath` can describe a specific object, or can use wildcards for fuzzy matching
/// of objects. Acceptable wildcards are either "*" (star) or "**" (double star).
/// Single star will search a single depth for the next object.
/// Double star will search any depth.

/// EG:
/// @"Layer.Shape Group.Stroke 1.Color"
/// Represents a specific color node on a specific stroke.
///
/// @"**.Stroke 1.Color"
/// Represents the color node for every Stroke named "Stroke 1" in the animation.
