/*!
 @brief Sets a LOTValueDelegate for each animation property returned from the LOTKeypath search. LOTKeypath matches views inside of LOTAnimationView to their After Effects counterparts. The LOTValueDelegate is called every frame as the animation plays to override animation values. A delegate can be any object that conforms to the LOTValueDelegate protocol, or one of the prebuilt delegate classes found in LOTBlockCallback, LOTInterpolatorCallback, and LOTValueCallback.

 @discussion
 Example that sets an animated stroke to Red using a LOTColorValueCallback.
 @code
 LOTKeypath *keypath = [LOTKeypath keypathWithKeys:@"Layer 1", @"Ellipse 1", @"Stroke 1", @"Color", nil];
 LOTColorValueCallback *colorCallback = [LOTColorBlockCallback withColor:[UIColor redColor]];
 [animationView setValueDelegate:colorCallback forKeypath:keypath];
 @endcode

 See the documentation for LOTValueDelegate to see how to create LOTValueCallbacks. A delegate can be any object that conforms to the LOTValueDelegate protocol, or one of the prebuilt delegate classes found in LOTBlockCallback, LOTInterpolatorCallback, and LOTValueCallback.

 See the documentation for LOTKeypath to learn more about how to create keypaths.

 NOTE: The delegate is weakly retained. Be sure that the creator of a delegate is retained.
