/** LOTAnimationTransitionController
 *
 *  This class creates a custom UIViewController transition animation
 *  using a Lottie animation to transition between two view controllers
 *  The transition can use custom defined layers in After Effects for to/from
 *
 *  When referencing After Effects layers the animator masks or transforms the to/from viewController
 *  with the referenced layer.
