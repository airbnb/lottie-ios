[info] `strokeStart` animation for "Shape Layer 17.Ellipse 1.Trim Paths 1" includes an After Effects expression (https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/using/expression-language.html), which is not supported by lottie-ios (expressions are only supported by lottie-web). This animation may not play correctly.
[assertionFailure] Encountered Core Animation compatibility issues while setting up animation:
[dotted_lines.Ellipse 1.Stroke 1] The Core Animation rendering engine does not support animating multiple keyframes for stroke dashPattern values, due to limitations of Core Animation.
[dotted_lines.Ellipse 1.Stroke 1] The Core Animation rendering engine does not support animating multiple keyframes for stroke dashPattern values, due to limitations of Core Animation.
[Dotted_lines.Ellipse 1.Stroke 1] The Core Animation rendering engine does not support animating multiple keyframes for stroke dashPattern values, due to limitations of Core Animation.
[Dotted_lines.Ellipse 1.Stroke 1] The Core Animation rendering engine does not support animating multiple keyframes for stroke dashPattern values, due to limitations of Core Animation.

This animation cannot be rendered correctly by the Core Animation engine.
To resolve this issue, you can use `RenderingEngineOption.automatic`, which automatically falls back
to the Main Thread rendering engine when necessary, or just use `RenderingEngineOption.mainThread`.
