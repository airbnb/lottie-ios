[warning] Encountered Core Animation compatibility issue while setting up animation:
[dotted_lines.Ellipse 1.Stroke 1] The Core Animation rendering engine does not support animating multiple keyframes for stroke dashPattern values, due to limitations of Core Animation.
This animation may have additional compatibility issues, but animation setup was cancelled early to avoid wasted work.

Automatically falling back to Main Thread rendering engine. This fallback comes with some additional performance
overhead, which can be reduced by manually specifying that this animation should always use the Main Thread engine.
